# SpartanSafety

Have you ever felt uneasy on Michigan Stateâ€™s huge campus?
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt the MSU police department should be aware of something you have seen?

Instead of letting whatever you have experienced be unreported, use the SpartanSafety. This app has been designed to let you text MSUPD your current location and a description of the problem. Help is only a tap away!

The SpartanSafety app also has a resource page with contacts for health, addiction, and safety information. Tap to view live updates from MSU and East Lansing Police Department's Twitter pages.
